**Subject:** Access Issue with DRR GitHub Repository Due to SSO Conflict

Dear \[Recipient's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

I’m reaching out regarding access to the private DRR GitHub repository:
[https://github.com/rosetta-models/digital-regulatory-reporting](https://github.com/rosetta-models/digital-regulatory-reporting)

I’ve already raised an access request for my email ID and was advised to create a GitHub username for repository access. Accordingly, I created the username **snanduri93**.

However, I’m currently facing access issues within the bank environment due to GitHub's SSO enforcement. Our organization uses SSO-based GitHub access, which automatically generates a different profile under the username **saisandeep-nanduri\_boa**. As a result, I am unable to access the repository using the originally approved username.

Would it be possible to either:

* Extend access permissions to my SSO-linked GitHub account (**saisandeep-nanduri\_boa**),
  or
* Advise on how to align access with our SSO setup?

Appreciate your help in resolving this so I can proceed with the work.

Best regards,
Sandeep Nanduri
